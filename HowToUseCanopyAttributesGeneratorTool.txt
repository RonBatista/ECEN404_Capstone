To use the tool, the user first needs to select a Project along with a Platform and Sensor. After these
are selected the user must then select an Orthomosaic file and Boundary file. A Canopy Height Model file
can be selected but is not necessary. It is only necessary if you want to generate Canopy Volume or Canopy
Height. After selecting all needed and wanted files, the user can decide on what canopy attributes
to generate including the Canopy Cover, Canopy Height, Canopy Volume and Excess Greenness. Please remember that
the Canopy Height and Canopy Height cannot be generated unless a Canopy Height Model file is selected. After clicking the
"Generate Results" button, the user can then select the canopy attributes and file formats (Shape, GeoJSON, CSV and XLSX)
they would like to download. The generated files are available to download through the "Download Generated Files"
button, which will then download a Zip file of the specified attributes and file formats.
